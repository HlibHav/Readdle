ðŸ”§ CORS FIX - Add One More Environment Variable:

The Railway dashboard is now open. You need to add ONE more environment variable:

1. Click on your SERVICE in the Railway dashboard
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Click "New Variable"
4. Add this:

Variable Name: FRONTEND_URL
Value: https://web-obrqtyqdn-hlibhavs-projects.vercel.app

5. Save and wait for Railway to redeploy (1-2 minutes)

This will fix the CORS issue and allow your frontend to communicate with the backend.

After adding this variable, refresh your frontend and the "Failed to load page" error should disappear!
