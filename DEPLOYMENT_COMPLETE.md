### Step 2: Update Vercel Frontend (1 minute)

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Find your **Readdle** project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Find `VITE_API_URL` or add it if it doesn't exist
5. Set the value to **your Railway URL from Step 1**
6. Select **Production** environment
7. Click **Save**
8. Go to **Deployments** tab
9. Click the **︙** menu on the latest deployment
10. Click **"Redeploy"**

### Step 3: Test Your Application! 🎉

1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. The "Failed to load page" error should be gone!
3. Test the functionality:
   - Load a webpage
   - Try the AI features
   - Check document library

## 🔧 Alternative: Quick CLI Commands (if you prefer)

If you've completed Step 1 in the Railway dashboard and have your Railway URL, you can update Vercel via CLI:

```bash
cd /Users/Glebazzz/Readdle/web
vercel env add VITE_API_URL production
# Enter your Railway URL when prompted
vercel --prod
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Railway deployment failing?
- Check the **Logs** tab in Railway dashboard
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
- The build should show: `✅ documents-browser-server@1.0.0 build`

### Frontend still shows error?
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set in Vercel
- Check it matches your Railway URL exactly
- Make sure you redeployed after changing the variable
- Try opening DevTools (F12) → Network tab to see the actual request

### Backend not responding?
- Check Railway logs for startup errors
- Verify the service is "Active" in Railway
- Test the health endpoint: `https://your-railway-url/health`

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test all features thoroughly**
2. **Monitor Railway logs** for any errors
3. **Check Vercel Analytics** for performance
4. **Consider adding**:
   - Custom domain
   - Error monitoring (Sentry)
   - Analytics
   - More RAG strategies

## 📝 Important Notes

- ⚠️ **API Keys**: Your keys are now set in Railway's environment
- 🔒 **Security**: Never commit .env files to git
- 💰 **Costs**: Both Vercel and Railway have free tiers
- 📈 **Scaling**: Both platforms auto-scale based on usage
