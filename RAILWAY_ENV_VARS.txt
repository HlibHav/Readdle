ðŸ”§ RAILWAY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES - COPY THESE EXACTLY:

In your Railway dashboard (which should be open):

1. Click on the SERVICE (not the project, but the service inside it)
2. Click the "Variables" tab
3. Click "New Variable" and add each of these:

Variable Name: OPENAI_API_KEY
Value: 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

Variable Name: NODE_ENV
Value: production

Variable Name: PORT
Value: 5174

Variable Name: PHOENIX_OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED

4. After adding all 5 variables, Railway will automatically redeploy
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete
6. Refresh your frontend: https://web-qup0j9qib-hlibhavs-projects.vercel.app

The "Failed to load page" error will disappear once the backend has these environment variables!
